Just Some Simple IDE / TextEditor with some cool features.

Created for when other IDE's are overkill or lack support for specific languages and compilers (including custom languages).

Designed for:
- Custom Language Development And Testing
- File Parser Development (coming soon via ParseAssist plugin)
- Lower Level Development (such as ASM and OSDev)

Basic, clean, and highly customizable.

Utilizes [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) and [AvaloniaEdit](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaEdit) to provide a corss platform desktop UI.
